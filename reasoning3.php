<h2>Tips and Tricks To Solve Data Sufficiency Questions</h2>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few tips and tricks which can be followed to solve the data sufficiency questions. Candidates can refer to these tips given below:</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that you do not make any assumptions. The information given in the question is the only fact that needs to be considered to answer the question</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While going point by point, try solving the answer with the first condition given. Then, keep adding on the next conditions given until you get an answer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, no data sufficiency question asked for a calculative answer. It mostly demands the candidates to know which conditions will help you reach the answer. So first read before answering</span></li>

<h1>Seating Arrangement</h1>
<p>Seating arrangement questions are the most common problem types in all entrance exams containing the Logical Reasoning section. These concepts involve the arrangement of objects/ people in many possible ways.</p>
<p>The advantages of attempting the seating arrangement questions in the examination are one question of seating arrangement is followed by five to six subquestions.</p>
<p>Hence, fetching more marks by solving one single question.</p>

<p>Following is the list of entrance exams where candidates can find the seating arrangement topic very often:</p>

<h2>What is a Seating Arrangement?</h2>
<p>The seating arrangement is the logical arrangement of either objects or people in a logical manner. One has to either perform the arrangement to answer the questions or decode the predefined arrangement by applying the logical analysis.</p>
<p>Listed below are the detailed explanation of each topic covered in Seating arrangement questions:</p>
<h3>Topic 1: Assumptions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Unless specified the direction at the top page is always assumed as North.</li>
<li>The right side of the page is the viewer’s left side and vice versa.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Topic 2: Linear Arrangement</h3>
<p>Any logical arrangement of objects or people either horizontally or vertically or diagonally is known as<strong>Linear arrangement</strong><p>
<p>Ex: The row of the travellers in a train, students in a prayer hall, etc.</p>

<h3>Topic 3: Circular Arrangement</h3>
<p>The arrangement of physical quantities in a circular manner is called a <strong>Circular arrangement</strong>.</p>
<p>There are two types of circular arrangement:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Facing the center:</strong> In this arrangement, every object or a person in the arrangement will be facing the center of the circle.</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of circular seating arrangement questions include Group discussion and playing cards etc.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Facing outwards:</strong> In this arrangement, every object or a person in the arrangement will be facing outwards.</li>
</ol>
<p>A perfect example of circular seating arrangement questions would be playing musical chairs.</p>

<h3>Topic 4: Seating arrangement in a photograph</h3>
<p><em>Question 1</em>: How different is the seating arrangement in actual and in the picture?</p>
<p>Five friends Deepthi, Bhagya, Ramya, Sushil, and Akash request Sugjna, their friend, to take their photograph. Bhagya, who is an attention seeker, is always in the middle of Ramya and Deepti. There is no one to the left of Akash. Ramya always stands next to Sushil. There is no girl between two boys. Who is at the extreme right end in the photograph?</p>
<p><em>Solution</em>:</p>
<p>The seating arrangement in actual would be Deepti- Bhagya-Ramya-Sushil, and Akash. But when the photograph of the above arrangement is taken a right and left references are changed. Since the photograph is held in front of us. The viewer’s right will be the photograph’s left, and the photograph’s right would be the viewer’s left. Hence, Deepti will be at the extreme right end in the photograph.</p>
<h3>Topic 5: Complex Arrangement</h3>
<p>Complex arrangements are very similar to linear arrangement problems in terms of arrangement and properties. But unlike linear arrangement, where the objects had only one property – their positioning, objects in the complex arrangement have multiple properties.</p>
<p>There are two methods to solve the problem:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Table Formation:</strong> The data is tabulated to match the properties based on the logical conditions provided in the questions.</li>
<li><strong>Matric Tabulation:</strong> The Properties are matched in the form of a matrix with the help of symbols and special characters to solve the questions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Among both the methods, the number of rows and columns depends on the complexity and the number of properties in the questions.</p>
<p>Given below is an example of <strong>complex seating arrangement</strong>:</p>
<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 2</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">: Amit, Bharati, Cheryl, Deepak, and Eric are five friends sitting in a restaurant. They are wearing caps of five different colours — yellow, blue, green, white and red. Also, they are eating five different snacks — burgers, sandwiches, ice cream, pastries, and pizza.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The person wearing a red cap is eating pastries.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Amit does not eat ice cream, and Cheryl is eating sandwiches.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bharati is wearing a yellow cap and Amit wearing a blue cap.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Eric is eating pizza and is not wearing a green cap.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Solution</em>:</p>
<p>There are five people in the scenario and each person is associated with two properties, viz. Colour of the caps, and the dish they are eating. Hence the tabulation method is easier to apply.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Amith</td>
<td>Bharati</td>
<td>Cheryl</td>
<td>Deepak</td>
<td>Eric</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Colour</td>
<td>Blue</td>
<td>Yellow</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dish</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>Sandwiches</td>
<td></td>
<td>Pizza</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The properties can be tabulated as shown from the given information.</p>
<p>We know that a person wearing a red cap is eating pastries. There is only one place possible in the table to fit this combination. That will be Deepak.</p>
<table >

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Amith</td>
<td>Bharati</td>
<td>Cheryl</td>
<td>Deepak</td>
<td>Eric</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Colour</td>
<td>Blue</td>
<td>Yellow</td>
<td></td>
<td>Red</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dish</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>Sandwiches</td>
<td>Pastries</td>
<td>Pizza</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p>We also know that Eric is not wearing a green cap. Hence, the one who is wearing a green cap should be Cheryl. Since Amith does not eat Ice Cream, it should be Bharati who is eating it. That leaves us with the fact that Amith should be eating burgers as that&#8217;s the only dish left. And hence, Eric should be wearing a white cap.</p>
<table>

<td>Amith</td>
<td>Bharati</td>
<td>Cheryl</td>
<td>Deepak</td>
<td>Eric</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Colour</td>
<td>Blue</td>
<td>Yellow</td>
<td>Green</td>
<td>Red</td>
<td>White</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Burger</td>
<td>Ice cream</td>

<p><em>Question 3</em>: The king Akbar&#8217;s court &#8211; Navratnas Nauratan (Sanskrit dvigu Nava-Ratna- or &#8220;nine gems&#8221;) was a term applied to a group of nine extraordinary people in an emperor&#8217;s court in Emperor Akbar&#8217;s &#8220;Darbar&#8221; The Mughal ruler Akbar, despite his illiteracy, was a great lover of the artists and intellectuals. His passion for knowledge and interest in learning from great minds attracted him to men of genius to his court, known as the nine courtiers of Emperor Akbar or Navratnas (Nine Jewels):</p>
<ol>
<li>Birbal</li>
<li>Faizi</li>
<li>Todar Mal</li>
<li>Man Singh I</li>
<li>Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana</li>
<li>Fakir Aziao-Din</li>
<li>Tansen</li>
<li>Mulla Do-Piyaza</li>
<li>Abu&#8217;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak</li>
</ol>
<p>Arrange them in an order of their seating pattern based on the following instructions:</p>
<p>The Nine gems and Akbar always made a circular arrangement when they sat in a court.</p>
<ol>
<li>Akbar always sat opposite to his favourite advisor.</li>
<li>A singer always sat opposite to a poet, there were two poets in his court among them one was a tutor.</li>
<li>Mulla Do-Piyaza never sat next to Birbal as he was his rival.</li>
<li>Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana is neither general nor finance minister.</li>
<li>Maan Singh sat in between a poet and a finance minister.</li>
<li>Tansen was at third to the right of Birbal</li>
<li>An adviser was in great jealous of another advisor Birbal hence he made Birbal his rival.</li>
<li>Faizi is a poet who was third to the left of the finance minister.</li>
<li>Fakir Aziao-Din a chef minister sat in between a singer and an author Abu&#8217;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak.</li>

<p>Solved examples: <strong>Linear seating arrangement</strong></p>
<p><em>Question 4</em>: Meenakshi and Anupama two best friends wanted to arrange books in their small library. They arranged these books as a pile one over the other. There are 3 computer science books, 3 reasoning books, 2 math books, 2 interview books, and 2 English books. A Computer science book is either at the top or bottom-most level.</p>
<p>Starting from the top a reasoning book is between a math book and computer science book (either of the mentioned Math or Computer Science books may be at the top of reasoning book), an English book is between a maths book and computer science book. A reasoning book is the third book from the bottom. An interview book is between a math book that is in sixth place from the top and a reasoning book. Another interview book is in between two reasoning books. A computer science book is in between reasoning and English.</p>
<p>Which book is in fourth place from the bottom?</p>
<p>A.Computer Science</p>
<p>B.English</p>
<p>C.Reasoning</p>
<p>D.Interview</p>
<p><em>Solution</em>:</p>
<p>There are 3 computer science books, 3 reasoning books, 2 maths books, 2 interview books, and 2 English books. Hence the total number of books is twelve.</p>
<p>The arrangement of these books as shown below:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
